# What works and what doesn't work with this chart?
## Works
Sorry but finding positive feedback is too hard for me. Will move to next section ... 

## Does not work
1. The worst thing about this visulization is that is shows only **one** dimension of the **data** and does not really give any meaningful **information**. It only shows the USD expense per country in a specific year and totally misses the (a) important normalization relative to GDP and (b) the evolution across time.
2. The chart itself is not standard stacked bar even though it looks like it at first glance. Actually there is an overlay of the Voluntary, behind it the Compulsory and total is behind them. Actually the portion of the voluntary is depicted twice. This is very confusing (to me). Only if you select in the 'Perspective' filter the Total and one other perspective the display makes sense.
3. Initially I thought the interactive aspect of this works but it doesn't. When you play with the 'Timeline' slider the chart type changes and it becomes a mess.

# How can you make it better?
1. Simple bar-chart chart seems (again) like best way to show the data in original visualization (labels fit contry names, context of OECD average gives good context for this dimenssion)
2. Tempted to place on a map but since many countries have no data it did not come out well
3. The interesting dimenssions I see are (a) evolution across time and (b) expense as % of GDP

... Did not finish something submitable
